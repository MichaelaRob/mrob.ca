      {% pattern cards/reversed-photo-text-button image="mockup-mike.jpg" heading="Mike Robinson Team" subheading="Website Redesign" text="I redesigned this real estate website to refresh the layout. I focused on creating a design that was more user friendly while remaining attractive and using more quality imagery to look more professional. I stuck to the clientâ€™s brand, using their brand colours but decided to use new typography. The handwritten font gives energy and a friendly feel to the other more traditional fonts. Please visit the following link for full video on the redesign:" %}

I used emotion and humour to help sell the company brand and to communicate that their products are each unique waiting for their perfect match to buy them.
