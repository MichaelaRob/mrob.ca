  {% pattern cards/photo-text-card image="about-me.png" heading="About me" text="I'm a graphic designer from Ottawa, Canada. I’m terrible at math. Early on, I knew I would never be someone who works with numbers, but I was promised there’s no way to make a living being creative. I made a promise to myself to love what I do for a living. Design for me, is a way of life, full of colour. I started my education using paint, brushes and pencils and ended with a computer and a mouse, proving that I can in fact have a career from being creative and I can just google my math problems." %}
