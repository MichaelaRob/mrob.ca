I used traditional Chinese motifs alongside a representation of a Chinese dragon in order to speak to the companyâ€™s brand. This design solution not only helps to create a brand for this the oldest thriving Chinese restaurant in Ottawa but also serves to elevate the brand. Along with the new packaging, I created an app. When the barcode from the take-out box is scanned, the Golden Palace app downloads which allows the user to order food and read their personalised fortune." %}

The redesign demonstrates my ability to think in three dimensional forms while working in one dimensional form on the computer. This showcases my ability to bring a thought or design to life in a real tangible way and my ability to work through difficulties to figure out a viable solution" %}
